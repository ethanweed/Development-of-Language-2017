@Transcriber:	Shari Epstein, Malcah Yaeger, with help from Richard Steiner.
@Comment:	Son calls Ma who passes him off to Ephraim (aka 'Tatie'/Daddy). someone is getting engaged, and both the son and daughter (Rachel) want to get into the city for the celebration. The daughter must be in or near an orthodox camp near MONROE, which is an area in the Catskills with small bungalow colonies of religious Jews, near the Satmer Hassidic summer colony of Kiryas Joel. The dad is trying to explain to the son that it is too complicated for the teacher from his camp to pick someone up at her camp near Monroe, because the area is not well mapped, and the daughter should be asking someone from nearby Kiryas Joel (the Satmer town) if she could get a ride from them.
