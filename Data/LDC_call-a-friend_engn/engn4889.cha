@Comment:	This file is rich in delivery/birth stories. F1 is 27, had two years of college, and is calling her friend Yoheved (F2) in her hospital room right after she has given birth. F2 has preschool age twins named Atara and Shimmy (Shmuel); her husband's name may be Yimmy or Jimmy. F2 encourages F1 in her newly established children's clothes business.
