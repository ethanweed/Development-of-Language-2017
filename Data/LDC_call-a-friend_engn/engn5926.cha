@Comment:	Both F1 and F2 ("Mom" and Julie "J") are Americans, although Julie is currently living in Montreal with her Canadian fiance Yves (who needs an American work permit before they move to California). "Mom" is 57 years old, has a college education, and lives with her mother near Spokane, Washington. She calls Julie on Thanksgiving. They discuss Julie's wedding plans; natural childbirth techniques; Julie's estranged brother Bobby; and Mom's personal issues.
