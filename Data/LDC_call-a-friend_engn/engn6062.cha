@Comment:	F1, whose name sounds like "Lah-den," is 22 years old with two years of college. She most likely lives in Philadelphia, as she frequents a downtown bar called McGlinchy's. She is originally from New Jersey, however, and is calling her friend Cindy in Atlantic City. Both women are college students and start out discussing late papers; Cindy also makes money as a waitress. They then turn to talking about their social lives, including dancing topless on bars and getting shit-faced drunk, etc. About half the conversation is Cindy's narrative. Cindy is a chain smoker, and inhales loudly and frequently; these are often transcribed as hhh, and do not imply that a word search or place holding is going on. They get into some interesting Adult-Children-of-Alcholics pop psychology in the last five minutes.
