@Comment:	Debbie is a 25-year-old screenwriter with two years of graduate school (she just passed her comps, Penn student). She lives in Philadelphia but wants to move to New York. She is calling her friend Sara in Minnesota, who just got back from a vacation visiting another friend in Puerto Rico. Sara discusses which graduate programs she and the other friend plan to apply to this year; Debbie talks about the success of her screenplays and the details of her current temp job.
