@Transcriber:	Sarah Longstaff, Alan Beaudrie starts transcribing at line 1080
@Comment:	M1 is a 21-year-old from Michigan with three years of college; he is calling a friend in Detroit. They talk about cycling and the usefulness and upkeep of bicycles; M1's swim-team training regime; M2's organization of back issues of magazines; M1's greedy ex-roommate. M2 brags about how his part-Jewish background makes him an excellent bargainer. M1 and M2 talk about their grades from their recent semester of college.
@Comment:	Both speakers often speak very quickly, so not noted in each case. Music plays in the background of M2 continuosly. hhh Conversation begins
