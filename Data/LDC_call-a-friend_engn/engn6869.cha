@Comment:	M1, a Penn student, wants to use up his phone card and finally gets someone (his friend Gus) on the phone. Gus, however, is playing darts with his roommate and is not very chatty. They discuss their weekend plans and arrange to meet for breakfast at a dinner near the university. Gus's phone volume is very low throughout--I have not marked all his utterances as quiet; M1's volume is loud and his breathing amplified--I have not marked his every breath.
