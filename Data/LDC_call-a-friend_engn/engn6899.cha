@Comment:	A mother (F1), 51 w college ed, trying to make desperate conversation with a disinterested (or sleepy) daughter (F2), 20's college ed., on the day before St. Patrick's Day. Daughter lives in Atlanta; moved there from Arizona (still jet-lagged). But all family members are from CT. (Family has a dog named Mitzy, who is with the daughter Karen--just like girl in file 6938, whose name was "Ren" [!])
