This address is called a path. Depending on the operating system of your computer, paths may look slightly different, but the overall format is the same. On my computer, if I save a text file called \"my_document\" on the desktop, it will have the path \"/Users/ethan/Desktop/my_document.txt\" Save a text file on your desktop, and figure out what the path to that document is. Write something in the text file, and make sure it is saved."

Also, my path will look different than your path, and if I type the whole path in like I did above, and share my code with you, you will have to go through and change the path everywhere it occurs in the script, so that the code works on your computer as well. A handy shortcut to avoid some of these problems is to save the path as a variable. Why not? It's just a string anyway, right?"
