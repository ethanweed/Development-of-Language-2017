Depending on the operating system of your computer, paths may look slightly different, but the overall format is the same. On my computer, if I save a text-file called \"my_document\" on the desktop, it will have the path \"/Users/ethan/Desktop/my_document.txt\" Save a text-file on your desktop, and figure out what the path to that document is. Write something in the text-file, and make sure it is saved."

It's called \"os\", and one of the things it can do is to change the active directory we are in: that is, we can move from one place to another on the computer. You already know the path to your new text file. In my case, it is. \"/Users/ethan/Desktop/my_document.txt\", so if I want to access that file from Python I type the following:\n",

Also, my path will look different than your path, and if I type the whole path in like I did above, if I share my codee with you, you will have to go through and change the path everywhere it occurs in the script, so that the code works on your computer as well. A handy shortcut to avoid some of these problems is to save the path as a variable. Why not? It's just a string anyway, right?"
